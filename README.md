# Home-Sales-Prediction

 
## Authors: Jennifer Savage, Madeline Riley, Linet Osoro

## Overview
This project aimed to predict housing prices using Zillow information and machine learning techniques. We sought to determine if data from Zillow could be effectively processed through various machine learning algorithms to predict home prices accurately. Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Linear Regression models were utilized for this analysis.


# Methodology
Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Read the CSV file into a Spark DataFrame.
Explained the data columns.
Dropped non-beneficial columns and handled missing values.
Converted data types and encoded categorical variables.
Converted Spark DataFrame into a pandas DataFrame.
Feature Selection and Target Definition:
Defined features (X) and the target variable (y) for the machine learning models.
Train-Test Split:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Feature Scaling:
Standardized features using StandardScaler to ensure mean 0 and variance 1.
Model Training and Prediction 


# Analysis
The data was cleaned, and different machine learning models were trained and tested to predict home prices. We evaluated the performance of each model and documented their accuracy percentages. The analysis provided insights into the effectiveness of various machine learning methods in predicting housing prices.
