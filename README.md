# Home-Sales-Prediction

 
# Authors: Jennifer Savage, Madeline Riley, Linet Osoro


# Overview
This project aimed to predict housing prices using Zillow information and machine learning techniques. We sought to determine if data from Zillow could be effectively processed through various machine learning algorithms to predict home prices accurately. Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Linear Regression models were utilized for this analysis.


# Methodology
Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Read the CSV file into a Spark DataFrame.
Dropped non-beneficial columns and handled missing values
Converted data types and encoded categorical variables
Converted Spark DataFrame into a pandas DataFrame
Feature Selection and Target Definition:
Defined features (X) and the target variable (y) for the machine learning models.
Train-Test Split the dataset into training and testing sets
Feature StandardScaler to ensure mean 0 and variance 1
Model Training and Prediction 
Model Testing. 

# Analysis
The data was cleaned, and different machine learning models were trained and tested to predict home prices. We evaluated the performance of each model and documented their accuracy percentages. The analysis provided insights into the effectiveness of various machine learning methods in predicting housing prices.

## Collaboration
This project was a collaborative effort among team members with the assistance of tutors. The code is original and was developed using a combination of class assignments, tutor guidance, and instructor support.
