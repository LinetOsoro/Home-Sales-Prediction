# Home-Sales-Prediction
Jennifer Savage, Madeline Riley, Linet Osoro

The purpose of this project was to solve a problem or answer a question using machine learning methods. 

The purpose of this project was to determine if data taken from Zillow could be run through machine learning methods to predict the price of the home with any degree of accuracy. The data was cleaned, trained and tested and run through several different machine learning methods to display the percent of accuracy the methods returned. 

We used Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Linear Regression Model.

Analysis: talk about ml methods and results/accuracy

This project was done in collaboration with classmates with the assistance of of tutors. The code is original and was created using the help of class assignments, tutors, and instructors.
