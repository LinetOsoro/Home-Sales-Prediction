# Predicting home sales prices using Zillow information
# Typically involves using various features or factors related to the properties to estimate their values accurately. 

# Location: The location of a property is one of the most significant factors influencing its price. 
# This includes factors like the neighborhood, proximity to amenities (schools, parks, shopping centers), 
# crime rates, and local market conditions.

# Property Characteristics: Features of the property itself, such as size (square footage), number of bedrooms and bathrooms, 
# lot size, floor plan, age of the property, architectural style, and condition (renovations, upgrades).

# Market Trends: Overall market trends, including supply and demand dynamics, interest rates, economic conditions, 
# and housing market cycles, can impact home prices.

# Comparable Sales (Comps): Analysis of recent sales of similar properties (comparable sales or "comps") in the area 
# provides valuable insights into pricing trends and helps determine the fair market value of a property.

# Property History: Factors related to the property's history, such as its purchase price, sale history, 
# previous appraisals, and any past renovations or improvements, can influence its current value.

# Local Regulations and Zoning Laws: Zoning regulations, building codes, and local government policies can affect property values 
# by influencing factors like land use, development potential, and property taxes.

# Amenities and Features: Additional amenities and features such as swimming pools, outdoor spaces, energy-efficient upgrades, 
# smart home technology, and luxury finishes can contribute to higher property values.

# Economic Indicators: Economic indicators such as employment rates, income levels, inflation, and GDP growth 
# can impact housing demand and affordability, thus influencing home prices.

# Seasonality: Seasonal factors, such as the time of year and weather conditions, can affect home buying and selling activity, 
# which may influence prices.

# External Factors: External factors such as interest rates, mortgage availability, housing affordability, 
# and demographic trends can also impact home prices.

# Predictive models for home prices usually incorporate a combination of these factors using techniques 
# such as regression analysis, machine learning algorithms, and data mining to analyze large datasets 
# and identify patterns that help predict property values accurately.

# Data Loading and Preprocessing:

## Data Loading and Preprocessing 
# Read the CSV file "original_extracted_df" into a Spark DataFrame.

***Explaining the data ***(columns: 
SalePrice - the property's sale price in dollars.

LotArea: Lot size in square feet

Bedroom: Number of bedrooms above basement level0*******

# Drop non-beneficial columns from the DataFrame.

# Remove rows with missing values.

## Data Conversion and Encoding:
# Convert the data types of columns as per the predefined map.

# Convert the Spark DataFrame into a pandas DataFrame.

# Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

## Feature Selection and Target Definition:
# Define the features (X) and the target variable (y) for the machine learning models.

## Train-Test Split:
# Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Feature Scaling:
# Standardize the features using StandardScaler to ensure that they have mean 0 and variance 1.

# Model Training and Prediction (Linear Regression):

## Train a Linear Regression model on the training data.

## Make predictions on the test data using the trained model.

## Model Evaluation (Linear Regression):

# Calculate the R-squared score to evaluate the goodness of fit.

# Compute the mean squared error (MSE) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) to assess the model's performance.

# Display Results:

# Print the evaluation metrics for the Linear Regression model to assess their performance.

# Model Training and Prediction (Decision Tree Classifier):

## Train a Decision Tree Classifier on the training data.

## Make predictions on the test data using the trained model.

# Model Evaluation (Decision Tree Classifier):

## Calculate the accuracy score to evaluate the classifier's performance.

## Generate a classification report to provide a detailed summary of the classifier's performance.

# Display Results:

# Print the evaluation metrics for the Decision Tree Classifier to assess their performance.
